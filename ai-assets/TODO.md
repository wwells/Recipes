# Phase 2 Implementation Todo: GitHub Integration

## Overview
Phase 2 focuses on implementing permanent storage via GitHub integration, allowing recipes added via localStorage to be synced to the repository for permanent storage.

## Phase 2 Goal
Transform the current localStorage-only system into a hybrid system where:
- New recipes are immediately stored in localStorage (instant feedback)
- Recipes can be synced to GitHub for permanent storage
- The system works offline with sync when online

## Priority 1: GitHub API Integration

### 1. GitHub Authentication Setup
- [ ] Research GitHub API authentication options
- [ ] Choose authentication method (Personal Access Token vs OAuth)
- [ ] Set up GitHub API credentials
- [ ] Test API connectivity

### 2. GitHub API Implementation
- [ ] Create GitHub API client functions
- [ ] Implement recipe reading from GitHub repo
- [ ] Implement recipe writing to GitHub repo
- [ ] Handle API rate limits and errors
- [ ] Add retry logic for failed requests

### 3. Data Sync Workflow
- [ ] Design sync state management
- [ ] Implement "pending changes" detection
- [ ] Create sync status indicators in UI
- [ ] Add manual sync button
- [ ] Handle sync conflicts (local vs remote changes)

## Priority 2: User Interface Updates

### 4. Sync Status UI
- [ ] Add sync status indicator (synced/pending/error)
- [ ] Show pending changes count
- [ ] Add sync button to header
- [ ] Display sync progress/status messages
- [ ] Add sync error handling and user feedback

### 5. Recipe Management UI
- [ ] Distinguish between local and synced recipes
- [ ] Add "pending" state for unsynced recipes
- [ ] Show sync status on individual recipe cards
- [ ] Add ability to retry failed syncs
- [ ] Implement batch sync operations

## Priority 3: Offline Capabilities

### 6. Offline Support
- [ ] Implement offline detection
- [ ] Queue changes when offline
- [ ] Sync when connection restored
- [ ] Handle offline/online state changes
- [ ] Add offline indicator in UI

### 7. Conflict Resolution
- [ ] Detect conflicts between local and remote data
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution UI
- [ ] Allow user to choose local vs remote version
- [ ] Handle merge conflicts gracefully
- [ ] Add conflict resolution logging

## Priority 4: Testing & Polish

### 8. Testing Framework
- [ ] Add tests for GitHub API functions
- [ ] Test sync workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Test offline/online scenarios
- [ ] Test conflict resolution
- [ ] Add integration tests for sync process

### 9. Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] Handle network failures gracefully
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for retries
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Create recovery procedures for corrupted data
- [ ] Add logging for debugging sync issues

### 10. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize sync performance for large datasets
- [ ] Implement incremental sync (only changed data)
- [ ] Add sync progress indicators
- [ ] Optimize API calls to minimize rate limit issues
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data

## Priority 5: Documentation & Deployment

### 11. User Documentation
- [ ] Document sync workflow for users
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add FAQ for common sync issues
- [ ] Document offline usage patterns
- [ ] Create user guide for conflict resolution

### 12. Technical Documentation
- [ ] Document GitHub API integration
- [ ] Document sync architecture
- [ ] Create deployment guide for Phase 2
- [ ] Document testing procedures
- [ ] Update SPEC.md with Phase 2 details

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

**Priority 1: Research & Planning**
1. Research GitHub API authentication options
2. Design sync workflow architecture
3. Plan UI changes for sync status

**Priority 2: Core Implementation**
4. Implement GitHub API client
5. Create basic sync functionality
6. Add sync status to UI

**Priority 3: Testing & Polish**
7. Test sync workflow end-to-end
8. Add error handling and recovery
9. Deploy and test Phase 2

## Success Criteria for Phase 2
- [ ] New recipes can be synced to GitHub for permanent storage
- [ ] Sync status is clearly visible in the UI
- [ ] System works offline with sync when online
- [ ] Conflicts are handled gracefully
- [ ] All existing functionality (search, filter, display) continues to work
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable with sync overhead
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback to users

## Technical Considerations
- **GitHub API Limits**: 5,000 requests/hour for authenticated users
- **File Size Limits**: GitHub has file size limits for API operations
- **Authentication**: Personal Access Token vs OAuth app
- **Data Format**: JSON structure for recipes.json
- **Conflict Strategy**: Last-write-wins vs manual resolution

## Next Steps After Phase 2
1. Use the app with real data and sync workflow
2. Identify pain points and missing features
3. Plan Phase 3 enhancements
4. Consider additional features based on usage patterns
