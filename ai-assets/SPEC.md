- **Performance testing**: Load time with 292 recipes

## Architecture Decision: Hybrid Approach (Target)

### **Target Architecture: Pure Static + GitHub Integration**
- **Frontend**: Static site with client-side data management
- **Immediate storage**: Browser localStorage for instant feedback
- **Permanent storage**: GitHub repo via manual commits
- **Benefits**: Free, simple, immediate UX, version controlled
- **User flow**: Add recipe → Immediate local storage → Optional GitHub commit

### **User Flow for Adding Recipes (Target)**
1. **User finds recipe** → Clicks "Add Recipe" button
2. **Form appears** → User enters URL, title, tags
3. **Form submission** → JavaScript adds to localStorage immediately
4. **Recipe appears** → Shows in list instantly (pending state)
5. **Background sync** → App offers to commit changes to GitHub
6. **Optional manual sync** → User can also manually commit later

### **Data Flow**
```
Current State:
├── recipes.json (GitHub) - 292 recipes
└── localStorage (browser) - 0 pending

After adding 3 recipes:
├── recipes.json (GitHub) - 292 recipes (unchanged)
└── localStorage (browser) - 3 pending recipes

After syncing:
├── recipes.json (GitHub) - 295 recipes (updated)
└── localStorage (browser) - 0 pending (cleared)
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Pure Static Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Set up local development environment
- [x] Set up GitHub Pages repository
- [x] Create basic HTML/CSS/JS structure
- [x] Import existing CSV data to JSON format
- [x] Implement basic recipe display and navigation
- [x] Add recipe functionality using localStorage only
- [x] Basic tag management and filtering
- [x] Mobile optimization
- [x] Deploy to GitHub Pages

**Phase 1 Status: COMPLETE** ✅
- Site live at: https://recipes.waltwells.com/
- All 292 recipes loading and searchable
- Add recipe functionality working (localStorage)
- Mobile interface tested and working
- Ready for Phase 2 development

### Phase 2: Hybrid GitHub Integration ⚠️ SECURITY CONCERNS
- [ ] **ON HOLD**: Implement GitHub integration for permanent storage
- [ ] **ON HOLD**: Add "pending changes" indicator
- [ ] **ON HOLD**: Create sync workflow (localStorage ↔ GitHub)
- [ ] **ON HOLD**: Handle conflict resolution
- [ ] **ON HOLD**: Add offline capabilities
- [ ] **ON HOLD**: Batch commit functionality

**⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE IDENTIFIED:**
All proposed client-side GitHub integration approaches expose credentials in public static site, allowing malicious users to commit unwanted recipes to the repository.

**Phase 2 User Flow (ON HOLD):**
- Add recipes → Immediate localStorage → Optional GitHub commit
- Seamless sync between local and permanent storage
- Works offline with sync when online

**STATUS**: Architecture needs fundamental reconsideration to address security concerns.

### Phase 3: Enhancement
- [ ] Improve site design/layout:  Personalize
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering
- [ ] Auth?
- [ ] Add support for editing Recipes in the browser
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] GitHub integration for image storage
- [ ] Recipe sharing capabilities?

## GitHub Issue/PR Workflow (Phase 2+)

### Current Design
- Users submit new recipes via a GitHub Issue Form (mobile-friendly, no secrets required)
- A GitHub Action parses the issue, generates a new recipe entry, and attempts to create a PR to update `data/recipes.json`
- The PR is auto-merged if successful, triggering a GitHub Pages deployment

### Security & Simplicity
- No client-side secrets or tokens
- All automation is handled by GitHub Actions
- Full audit trail via issues and PRs

### Known Issues / Limitations
- Shell scripting for JSON is error-prone; quoting and formatting are tricky
- The workflow sometimes produces invalid JSON, causing PRs to fail or not merge
- The action runs on issue creation, but PR creation/merge may silently fail if errors occur
- Local testing is not always the same as GitHub Actions environment

### Lessons Learned
- Shell scripting for JSON manipulation is fragile and hard to test
- GitHub Actions YAML is sensitive to heredocs and multi-line strings
- Robust error handling and validation are essential

### Next Steps / Open Questions
- Move JSON generation and file update logic to Python scripts (invoked by the action)
- Add validation steps to check JSON validity before commit/push
- Improve error handling and logging in the workflow
- Ensure only `data/recipes.json` is updated (no temp files left behind)
- Make all logic easily testable locally

## Alternative Architectures (Rejected)

### Option A: GitHub Pages + Serverless Backend
- **Pros**: Seamless UX, real-time updates, **SECURE** (credentials server-side)
- **Cons**: More complex, potential costs
- **Decision**: Too complex for initial implementation, but **SECURITY CONCERN** may require reconsideration

### Option C: Self-hosted
- **Pros**: Full control, no external dependencies
- **Cons**: Requires home network access, more maintenance
- **Decision**: Doesn't meet "accessible anywhere" requirement

## ⚠️ SECURITY ARCHITECTURE CONCERNS

**Current Static Site Limitation**: Any client-side GitHub integration exposes credentials to all users, creating security vulnerabilities.

**Potential Solutions to Reconsider**:
1. **Serverless Functions**: Netlify/Vercel functions for secure GitHub API calls
2. **Backend Service**: Simple authenticated API backend
3. **GitHub Actions**: Automated commits via webhooks
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Static frontend + secure API backend

## Open Questions

1. **Tag strategy**: Should we clean up existing tags (fix "recipies" typo, standardize categories)?

2. **Search scope**: Just titles, or also include source domains?

3. **Sorting preferences**: Default sort by date added, or alphabetical by title?

4. **GitHub integration**: Should the app be able to add new images to repo, or just link to existing ones?

5. **Authentication**: Do you need any access control, or is this just for personal use?

6. **⚠️ CRITICAL**: How to implement secure GitHub integration without exposing credentials in client-side code?

7. **Architecture**: Should we move away from pure static site approach to address security concerns?

8. **Trade-offs**: What's the acceptable balance between UX convenience and security requirements?

## Success Criteria
- [x] Successfully import all 292 existing recipes
- [x] Mobile-friendly interface for cooking use
- [x] Fast recipe lookup and filtering
- [x] Reliable access from anywhere
- [x] Easy to maintain and migrate
- [x] No ongoing costs
- [x] No dependency on third-party services
- [x] Immediate feedback when adding recipes (Phase 1)
- [ ] Seamless sync with GitHub (Phase 2)

## Next Steps (Updated June 2024)
1. ✅ **Phase 1 Complete** - Basic functionality deployed and working
2. ⚠️ **Phase 2 ON HOLD** - Security concerns require architecture reconsideration
3. 🔄 **Security Analysis** - Evaluate alternative approaches for secure GitHub integration
4. 🔄 **Architecture Decision** - Choose between enhanced static site vs server-side approach
5. 🔄 **Revise Phase 2 Plan** - Update goals based on security requirements
6. 🔄 **Phase 3 Planning** - Consider additional enhancements (after security resolved)

## Development & Testing Workflow (2024-06)
- **Development tasks** (setup, test, dev server, clean) are managed via a Makefile, not npm scripts.
- **Testing**: Node.js is required for running command-line tests (`make test`).
- **Local server**: Python's built-in HTTP server is used for local development (`make dev`).
- **Test harness**: A simple Node.js-based test runner is in place for utility functions (see `tests/run_tests.js`).
- **No npm scripts**: All project automation is handled via Makefile for simplicity and portability.
